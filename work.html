            <p>
                After completing my studies at the diploma level, I have decided to take a short break from continuing my studies to the degree level. I have decided to work in a grocery store close to my home area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my work, I have gained a lot of new knowledge and new things that I have learned, whether they are related to my studies or not. Throughout my employment, I have gained an experience that I will not get anywhere else. Based on my past work experience, this is what has changed me a little at this point.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scope of my job while working in this grocery store includes sorting the stock items on the shelves, counting the stock in the storage store, weighing the spices, delivering the customer's items, and many other things I do.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the experiences I got while working here, I will never forget. And based on this experience, I will improve myself in the future.
            </p>
